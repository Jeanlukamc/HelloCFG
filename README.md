# HelloCFG
In this project I expore several existing grammars, replicating them with the use of the 'nltk' Python library to create the languages, then create my own simple programming language syntax within it as well. With my custom language, I shall then create logic to validate a program code to see if it's valid under my custom grammar using the CYK algorithm

- Grammars.py includes a bunch of languages written in CFG (Context Free Grammar), which are used as inputs to be process in Chomsky Normal Form. These grammars will then be used in the CYK algorithm, acting as a parser to detect inputs given by files collected in the FILES folder, used for testing whether the programs that were written within them are valid syntactically speaking.
- The creation of a programming language that combines aspects of Python and Java that I like is made into a language involving Morse Code. You can theoretically create files written in the language that I have done according to the rules of CFG in the Grammars file, but I also added a tool where you can transfer a file written in a specific way to detect certain reserved words to make parsing easier. My language uses '<>' along other symbols to separate letters and numbers in morse in a way that the parser will have an easier time determining whether a file is valid for the morse programming language.
