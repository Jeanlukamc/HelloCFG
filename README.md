# HelloCFG
In this project I expore several existing grammars, replicating them with the use of the 'nltk' Python library to create the languages, then create my own simple programming language syntax within it as well. With my custom language, I shall then create logic to validate a program code to see if it's valid under my custom grammar using the CYK algorithm
